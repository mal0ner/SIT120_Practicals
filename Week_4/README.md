# SIT120 WEEK 4 PRACTICAL TASKS: Vue practice

**Overview**:
The easiest way to try out Vue is by building a Hello world app. The installation for version 2 provides installing Vue and setting up the project. Complete the tasks and write 1-2 sentences reflection for each task.

## Task 1: Vue - Hello, World!

**Reflection**:

This task was a simple introduction to installing vue and its declarative rendering features, allowing one to render data to the DOM that is passed from the Vue component within the script.

## Task 2: Conditionals and Loops using Vue

**Reflection**:

Directives are special DOM element attributes in vue that come with a "v-" prefix
and are capable of giving those elements certain additional behaviour. v-if, v-else, v-show and v-for are examples of directives that allow one to reactively
update the UI rendering based on the state of data in the vue component.

## Task 3: Responsive Design with Vue

**Reflection**:

In this task I used a v-for directive to create and render a number of card-like
articles containers. These containers, despite being generated by Vue, could still
be styled in the normal fashion using a class-name. Media queries were also used
here to adjust the flex-direction of the articles container at the 600px breakpoint.

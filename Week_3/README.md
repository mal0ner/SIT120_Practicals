# SIT120 WEEK 3 PRACTICAL TASKS: JavaScript

**Overview**:
In this week, your goal is to gain better understanding of the web using basic JavaScript applications. Learn definitions of some new concepts/components. Note 1-2 sentences reflections for each task.

## Task 1: String methods

**Reflection**:
This task involved demonstrating usage of string primitive methods like slice,
replace, trim etc. An important point to note is that strings are immutable in
javascript and thus many of the methods return a new string instead of mutating
the original.

## Task 2: Array Methods

**Reflection**:
This task involved demonstrating knowledge of common array methods in javascript.
As strings are indexable much like arrays, there were a few shared properties and
methods such as length and concat(). The most compelling of the methods were
those that accepted callback functions as arguments and are powerful tools for
quickly applying functions to arrays.

## Task 3: JavaScript Date API

**Reflection**:
This task involved becoming at least partly familiar with the javascript date api.
The Date object when called is in the format of UNIX time, or the number of milliseconds that have passed since 1 Jan 1970. The object has a nuber of instance
methods that can be used to get certain elements of the time object in a number
of formats as well as manipulate it for other purposes.

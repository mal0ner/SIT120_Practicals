# SIT120 WEEK 3 PRACTICAL TASKS

**Overview**:
In this week, your goal is to gain better understanding of the web using basic JavaScript applications. Learn definitions of some new concepts/components. Note 1-2 sentences reflections for each task.

## Task 1:

**Reflection**:
This task involved demonstrating usage of string primitive methods like slice,
replace, trim etc. An important point to note is that strings are immutable in
javascript and thus many of the methods return a new string instead of mutating
the original.

## Task 2:

**Reflection**:
This task involved demonstrating knowledge of common array methods in javascript.
As strings are indexable much like arrays, there were a few shared properties and
methods such as length and concat(). The most compelling of the methods were
those that accepted callback functions as arguments and are powerful tools for
quickly applying functions to arrays.

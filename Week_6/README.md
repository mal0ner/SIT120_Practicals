# SIT120 WEEK 6 PRACTICAL TASKS: Vue JS - Handling User Input

**Overview**:

In this week, you will gain a better understanding of Vue.js Framework. You will understand how to handle user inputs and form Input bindings. You will know how binding and modifiers work. Please write 1-2 sentences reflection for each task.

## Task 1: Using the v-model directive for form input bindings

**Reflection**:

V-model allows us to automatically align data between user input elements and state contained within the Vue object. As demonstrated in the task, this data
can then be represented using Vue's declarative rendering syntax to be displayed back to the user.

## Task 2: checkboxes

**Reflection**:

The v-model directive can be applied to a wide range of input types. When applied to checkboxes, v-model will output a boolean value indicating whether or not the
box is selected. This behaviour can be modified to bind an alternate value by
specifying it in the value attribute of the input element.
